# Ukay (Buyer App - Front End Documentation)


## Home Page

This is the main inspiration of the home page that we will build for our product.

***Notes***

 - Almost retain all the UI elements just change the icon to our brand logo.
 - *`Designers`* label will be changed to *`Brands`*, and that component shall be a dropdown that contains trending brands.
 - There shall be an advertisement banner component sa place ng *Aarong Farniture Set* na nag-iislide like every 10 seconds automatically.
 - As is yung *`trending products`*,  `latest additions`, tapos dagdagan na rin ng *`trending categories`*
 - If may *`sale or percent off`* sa price display nalang beside sa original price yung *`net price`* ( naka emphasize ) and then percent off.
 - For the footer part, basis yung photo number two. Just include yung `work hours`, and then `join us in social networks`. Tapos katulad doon sa photo number one na social icons ganoon ang ilagay.
 - *When clicked yung search icon*, dapat mag display ng search box sa taas ng advertisement banners.
 - When sign in is clicked go to Sign Up component, cart icon button clicked go to Cart Component.
 - Remove the wishlist icon or the heart icon.
